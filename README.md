GGS-ImpactJS
============

Google Play Game Services Interface for ImpactJS

To use simply copy included files into your project and include 'plugins.google.gameservice'.

Update ./lib/plugins/google/constants.js to match your package.

Spawn a GoogleGameService entity and the rest of the templated behaviour is automated.

    this.spawnEntity(GoogleGameService, 0, 0);
